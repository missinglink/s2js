/**
 * Angle represents a 1D angle. The internal representation is a double precision value in radians, so conversion to and from radians is exact.
 * Conversions between E5, E6, E7, and Degrees are not always exact.
 *
 * For example, Degrees(3.1) is different from E6(3100000) or E7(31000000).
 *
 * The following conversions between degrees and radians are exact:
 *
 * 	    Degree*180 == Radian*Math.PI
 * 	Degree*(180/n) == Radian*(Math.PI/n)     for n == 0..8
 *
 * These identities hold when the arguments are scaled up or down by any power of 2. Some similar identities are also true, for example,
 *
 * 	Degree*60 == Radian*(Math.PI/3)
 *
 * But be aware that this type of identity does not hold in general.
 * For example:
 *
 * 	Degree*3 != Radian*(Math.PI/60)
 *
 * Similarly, the conversion to radians means that (Angle(x)*Degree).Degrees() does not always equal x.
 * For example:
 *
 * 	(Angle(45*n)*Degree).Degrees() == 45*n     for n == 0..8
 *
 * but
 *
 * 	(60*Degree).Degrees() != 60
 *
 * When testing for equality, you should allow for numerical errors (ApproxEqual)
 * or convert to discrete E5/E6/E7 values first.
