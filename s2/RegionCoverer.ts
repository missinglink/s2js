/**
 * RegionCoverer allows arbitrary regions to be approximated as unions of cells (CellUnion).
 * This is useful for implementing various sorts of search and precomputation operations.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 *
 * 	rc = new RegionCoverer({ maxLevel: 30, maxCells: 5 })
 * 	r = Cap.fromCenterArea(center, area)
 * 	covering = rc.covering(r)
 *
 * This yields a CellUnion of at most 5 cells that is guaranteed to cover the
 * given region (a disc-shaped region on the sphere).
 *
 * For covering, only cells where (level - MinLevel) is a multiple of LevelMod will be used.
 * This effectively allows the branching factor of the S2 CellID hierarchy to be increased.
 * Currently the only parameter values allowed are 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to
 * branching factors of 4, 16, and 64 respectively.
 *
 * Note the following:
 *
 *   - MinLevel takes priority over MaxCells, i.e. cells below the given level will
 *     never be used even if this causes a large number of cells to be returned.
 *
 *   - For any setting of MaxCells, up to 6 cells may be returned if that
 *     is the minimum number of cells required (e.g. if the region intersects
 *     all six face cells).  Up to 3 cells may be returned even for very tiny
 *     convex regions if they happen to be located at the intersection of
 *     three cube faces.
 *
 *   - For any setting of MaxCells, an arbitrary number of cells may be
 *     returned if MinLevel is too high for the region being approximated.
 *
 *   - If MaxCells is less than 4, the area of the covering may be
 *     arbitrarily large compared to the area of the original region even if
 *     the region is convex (e.g. a Cap or Rect).
 *
 * The approximation algorithm is not optimal but does a pretty good job in
 * practice. The output does not always use the maximum number of cells
 * allowed, both because this would not always yield a better approximation,
 * and because MaxCells is a limit on how much work is done exploring the
 * possible covering as well as a limit on the final output size.
 *
 * Because it is an approximation algorithm, one should not rely on the
 * stability of the output. In particular, the output of the covering algorithm
 * may change across different versions of the library.
 *
 * One can also generate interior coverings, which are sets of cells which
 * are entirely contained within a region. Interior coverings can be
 * empty, even for non-empty regions, if there are no cells that satisfy
 * the provided constraints and are contained by the region. Note that for
 * performance reasons, it is wise to specify a MaxLevel when computing
 * interior coverings - otherwise for regions with small or zero area, the
 * algorithm may spend a lot of time subdividing cells all the way to leaf
 * level to try to find contained cells.
