/**
 * referencePointForShape is a helper function for implementing various Shapes
 * ReferencePoint functions.
 *
 * Given a shape consisting of closed polygonal loops, the interior of the
 * shape is defined as the region to the left of all edges (which must be
 * oriented consistently). This function then chooses an arbitrary point and
 * returns true if that point is contained by the shape.
 *
 * Unlike Loop and Polygon, this method allows duplicate vertices and
 * edges, which requires some extra care with definitions. The rule that we
 * apply is that an edge and its reverse edge cancel each other: the result
 * is the same as if that edge pair were not present. Therefore shapes that
 * consist only of degenerate loop(s) are either empty or full; by convention,
 * the shape is considered full if and only if it contains an empty loop (see
 * LaxPolygon for details).
 *
 * Determining whether a loop on the sphere contains a point is harder than
 * the corresponding problem in 2D plane geometry. It cannot be implemented
 * just by counting edge crossings because there is no such thing as a point
 * at infinity that is guaranteed to be outside the loop.
 *
 * This function requires that the given Shape have an interior.
