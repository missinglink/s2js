/**
 * This file contains documentation of the various coordinate systems used throughout the library.
 * Most importantly, S2 defines a framework for decomposing the unit sphere into a hierarchy of "cells".
 * Each cell is a quadrilateral bounded by four geodesics.
 * The top level of the hierarchy is obtained by projecting the six faces of a cube onto the unit sphere, and lower levels are obtained by subdividing each cell into four children recursively.
 * Cells are numbered such that sequentially increasing cells follow a continuous space-filling curve over the entire sphere.
 * The transformation is designed to make the cells at each level fairly uniform in size.

/**
 * S2 Cell Decomposition
 *
 * The following methods define the cube-to-sphere projection used by
 * the Cell decomposition.
 *
 * In the process of converting a latitude-longitude pair to a 64-bit cell
 * id, the following coordinate systems are used:
 *
 *  (id)
 *    An CellID is a 64-bit encoding of a face and a Hilbert curve position
 *    on that face. The Hilbert curve position implicitly encodes both the
 *    position of a cell and its subdivision level (see s2cellid.go).
 *
 *  (face, i, j)
 *    Leaf-cell coordinates. "i" and "j" are integers in the range
 *    [0,(2**30)-1] that identify a particular leaf cell on the given face.
 *    The (i, j) coordinate system is right-handed on each face, and the
 *    faces are oriented such that Hilbert curves connect continuously from
 *    one face to the next.
 *
 *  (face, s, t)
 *    Cell-space coordinates. "s" and "t" are real numbers in the range
 *    [0,1] that identify a point on the given face. For example, the point
 *    (s, t) = (0.5, 0.5) corresponds to the center of the top-level face
 *    cell. This point is also a vertex of exactly four cells at each
 *    subdivision level greater than zero.
 *
 *  (face, si, ti)
 *    Discrete cell-space coordinates. These are obtained by multiplying
 *    "s" and "t" by 2**31 and rounding to the nearest unsigned integer.
 *    Discrete coordinates lie in the range [0,2**31]. This coordinate
 *    system can represent the edge and center positions of all cells with
 *    no loss of precision (including non-leaf cells). In binary, each
 *    coordinate of a level-k cell center ends with a 1 followed by
 *    (30 - k) 0s. The coordinates of its edges end with (at least)
 *    (31 - k) 0s.
 *
 *  (face, u, v)
 *    Cube-space coordinates in the range [-1,1]. To make the cells at each
 *    level more uniform in size after they are projected onto the sphere,
 *    we apply a nonlinear transformation of the form u=f(s), v=f(t).
 *    The (u, v) coordinates after this transformation give the actual
 *    coordinates on the cube face (modulo some 90 degree rotations) before
 *    it is projected onto the unit sphere.
 *
 *  (face, u, v, w)
 *    Per-face coordinate frame. This is an extension of the (face, u, v)
 *    cube-space coordinates that adds a third axis "w" in the direction of
 *    the face normal. It is always a right-handed 3D coordinate system.
 *    Cube-space coordinates can be converted to this frame by setting w=1,
 *    while (u,v,w) coordinates can be projected onto the cube face by
 *    dividing by w, i.e. (face, u/w, v/w).
 *
 *  (x, y, z)
 *    Direction vector (Point). Direction vectors are not necessarily unit
 *    length, and are often chosen to be points on the biunit cube
 *    [-1,+1]x[-1,+1]x[-1,+1]. They can be be normalized to obtain the
 *    corresponding point on the unit sphere.
 *
 *  (lat, lng)
 *    Latitude and longitude (LatLng). Latitudes must be between -90 and
 *    90 degrees inclusive, and longitudes must be between -180 and 180
 *    degrees inclusive.
 *
 * Note that the (i, j), (s, t), (si, ti), and (u, v) coordinate systems are
 * right-handed on all six faces.
 *
 *
 * There are a number of different projections from cell-space (s,t) to
 * cube-space (u,v): linear, quadratic, and tangent. They have the following
 * tradeoffs:
 *
 *   Linear - This is the fastest transformation, but also produces the least
 *   uniform cell sizes. Cell areas vary by a factor of about 5.2, with the
 *   largest cells at the center of each face and the smallest cells in
 *   the corners.
 *
 *   Tangent - Transforming the coordinates via Atan makes the cell sizes
 *   more uniform. The areas vary by a maximum ratio of 1.4 as opposed to a
 *   maximum ratio of 5.2. However, each call to Atan is about as expensive
 *   as all of the other calculations combined when converting from points to
 *   cell ids, i.e. it reduces performance by a factor of 3.
 *
 *   Quadratic - This is an approximation of the tangent projection that
 *   is much faster and produces cells that are almost as uniform in size.
 *   It is about 3 times faster than the tangent projection for converting
 *   cell ids to points or vice versa. Cell areas vary by a maximum ratio of
 *   about 2.1.
 *
 * Here is a table comparing the cell uniformity using each projection. Area
 * Ratio is the maximum ratio over all subdivision levels of the largest cell
 * area to the smallest cell area at that level, Edge Ratio is the maximum
 * ratio of the longest edge of any cell to the shortest edge of any cell at
 * the same level, and Diag Ratio is the ratio of the longest diagonal of
 * any cell to the shortest diagonal of any cell at the same level.
 *
 *               Area    Edge    Diag
 *              Ratio   Ratio   Ratio
 * -----------------------------------
 * Linear:      5.200   2.117   2.959
 * Tangent:     1.414   1.414   1.704
 * Quadratic:   2.082   1.802   1.932
 *
 * The worst-case cell aspect ratios are about the same with all three
 * projections. The maximum ratio of the longest edge to the shortest edge
 * within the same cell is about 1.4 and the maximum ratio of the diagonals
 * within the same cell is about 1.7.
 *
 * For Go we have chosen to use only the Quadratic approach. Other language
 * implementations may offer other choices.
