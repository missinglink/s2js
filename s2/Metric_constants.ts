 * purposes we redefine the width of a cell as the perpendicular distance
 * between a pair of opposite edges. A cell therefore has two widths, one
 * in each direction. The minimum width according to this definition agrees
 * with the classic geometric one, but the maximum width is different. (The
 * maximum geometric width corresponds to MaxDiag defined below.)
 *
 * The average width in both directions for all cells at level k is approximately
 * AvgWidthMetric.Value(k).
 *
 * The width is useful for bounding the minimum or maximum distance from a
 * point on one edge of a cell to the closest point on the opposite edge.
 * For example, this is useful when growing regions by a fixed distance.
