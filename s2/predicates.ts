  //
  // Essentially we can then just count in binary and test the corresponding
  // subset of perturbations at each step. So for example, we must test the
  // coefficient of db.Z*da.X before db.Y because eps**12 > eps**16.
  //
  // Of course, not all products of these perturbations appear in the
  // determinant above, since the determinant only contains the products of
  // elements in distinct rows and columns. Thus we don't need to consider
  // da.Z*da.Y, db.Y *da.Y, etc. Furthermore, sometimes different pairs of
  // perturbations have the same coefficient in the determinant; for example,
  // da.Y*db.X and db.Y*da.X have the same coefficient (c.Z). Therefore
