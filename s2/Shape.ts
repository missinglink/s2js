/**
 * Shape represents polygonal geometry in a flexible way. It is organized as a
 * collection of edges that optionally defines an interior. All geometry
 * represented by a given Shape must have the same dimension, which means that
 * a Shape can represent either a set of points, a set of polylines, or a set
 * of polygons.
 *
 * Shape is defined as an interface in order to give clients control over the
 * underlying data representation. Sometimes a Shape does not have any data of
 * its own, but instead wraps some other type.
 *
 * Shape operations are typically defined on a ShapeIndex rather than
 * individual shapes. A ShapeIndex is simply a collection of Shapes,
 * possibly of different dimensions (e.g. 10 points and 3 polygons), organized
 * into a data structure for efficient edge access.
 *
 * The edges of a Shape are indexed by a contiguous range of edge IDs
 * starting at 0. The edges are further subdivided into chains, where each
 * chain consists of a sequence of edges connected end-to-end (a polyline).
 * For example, a Shape representing two polylines AB and CDE would have
 * three edges (AB, CD, DE) grouped into two chains: (AB) and (CD, DE).
 * Similarly, a Shape representing 5 points would have 5 chains consisting
 * of one edge each.
 *
 * Shape has methods that allow edges to be accessed either using the global
 * numbering (edge ID) or within a particular chain. The global numbering is
 * sufficient for most purposes, but the chain representation is useful for
 * certain algorithms such as intersection (see BooleanOperation).
