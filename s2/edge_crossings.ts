/**
 * Reports whether two edges "cross" in such a way that point-in-polygon
 * containment tests can be implemented by counting the number of edge crossings.
 *
 * Given two edges AB and CD where at least two vertices are identical
 * (i.e. CrossingSign(a,b,c,d) == 0), the basic rule is that a "crossing"
 * occurs if AB is encountered after CD during a CCW sweep around the shared
 * vertex starting from a fixed reference point.
 *
 * Note that according to this rule, if AB crosses CD then in general CD
 * does not cross AB. However, this leads to the correct result when
 * counting polygon edge crossings. For example, suppose that A,B,C are
 * three consecutive vertices of a CCW polygon. If we now consider the edge
 * crossings of a segment BP as P sweeps around B, the crossing number
 * changes parity exactly when BP crosses BA or BC.
 *
 * Useful properties of VertexCrossing (VC):
 * (1) VC(a,a,c,d) == VC(a,b,c,c) == false

 * (3) VC(a,b,c,d) == VC(a,b,d,c) == VC(b,a,c,d) == VC(b,a,d,c)
 * (3) If exactly one of a,b equals one of c,d, then exactly one of
 *     VC(a,b,c,d) and VC(c,d,a,b) is true
 *
 * It is an error to call this method with 4 distinct vertices.
