 * satisfy a given condition (e.g. that cell vertices must be no further than
 * "x" apart). You can use the Value(level) method to compute the corresponding
 * length or area on the unit sphere for cells at a given level. The minimum

 * somewhat conservative for very large cells (e.g. face cells).
