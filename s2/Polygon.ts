/**
 * Polygon represents a sequence of zero or more loops; recall that the
 * interior of a loop is defined to be its left-hand side (see Loop).
 *
 * When the polygon is initialized, the given loops are automatically converted
 * into a canonical form consisting of "shells" and "holes". Shells and holes
 * are both oriented CCW, and are nested hierarchically. The loops are
 * reordered to correspond to a pre-order traversal of the nesting hierarchy.
 *
 * Polygons may represent any region of the sphere with a polygonal boundary,
 * including the entire sphere (known as the "full" polygon). The full polygon
 * consists of a single full loop (see Loop), whereas the empty polygon has no
 * loops at all.
 *
 * Use FullPolygon() to construct a full polygon. The zero value of Polygon is
 * treated as the empty polygon.
 *
 * Polygons have the following restrictions:
 *
 *   - Loops may not cross, i.e. the boundary of a loop may not intersect
 *     both the interior and exterior of any other loop.
 *
 *   - Loops may not share edges, i.e. if a loop contains an edge AB, then
 *     no other loop may contain AB or BA.
 *
 *   - Loops may share vertices, however no vertex may appear twice in a
 *     single loop (see Loop).
 *
 *   - No loop may be empty. The full loop may appear only in the full polygon.

    //    loop contains the complement of any other loop). This may result in a
    //    set of loops corresponding to the complement of the given polygon, but
    //    we will fix that problem later.
    //
    //    We make the loops nestable by first normalizing all the loops (i.e.,
    //    inverting any loops whose turning angle is negative). This handles
    //    all loops except those whose turning angle is very close to zero
    //    (within the maximum error tolerance). Any such loops are inverted if
    //    and only if they contain OriginPoint(). (In theory this step is only
    //    necessary if there are at least two such loops.) The resulting set of
    //    loops is guaranteed to be nestable.
    //
    // 3. Build the polygon. This yields either the desired polygon or its
    //    complement.
    //
    // 4. If there is at least one loop, we find a loop L that is adjacent to
    //    OriginPoint() (where "adjacent" means that there exists a path
    //    connecting OriginPoint() to some vertex of L such that the path does
    //    not cross any loop). There may be a single such adjacent loop, or

    //    origin whose depth is greatest, or loop(0) (a top-level shell) if no
    //    such loop exists.
    //
    // 5. If (L originally contained origin) != (polygon contains origin), we
    //    invert the polygon. This is done by inverting a top-level shell whose
    //    turning angle is minimal and then fixing the nesting hierarchy. Note
