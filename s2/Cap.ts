 * Cap represents a disc-shaped region defined by a center and radius.
 * Technically this shape is called a "spherical cap" (rather than disc)
 * because it is not planar; the cap represents a portion of the sphere that
 * has been cut off by a plane. The boundary of the cap is the circle defined
 * by the intersection of the sphere and the plane. For containment purposes,
 * the cap is a closed set, i.e. it contains its boundary.
 *
 * For the most part, you can use a spherical cap wherever you would use a
 * disc in planar geometry. The radius of the cap is measured along the
 * surface of the sphere (rather than the straight-line distance through the
 * interior). Thus a cap of radius π/2 is a hemisphere, and a cap of radius
 * π covers the entire sphere.
 *
 * The center is a point on the surface of the unit sphere. (Hence the need for
 * it to be of unit length.)
 *
 * A cap can also be defined by its center point and height. The height is the
 * distance from the center point to the cutoff plane. There is also support for
 * "empty" and "full" caps, which contain no points and all points respectively.
 *
 * Here are some useful relationships between the cap height (h), the cap
 * radius (r), the maximum chord length from the cap's center (d), and the
 * radius of cap's base (a).
 *
 *    h = 1 - Math.cos(r)
 *      = 2 * Math.sin^2(r/2)
 *    d^2 = 2 * h
 *      = a^2 + h^2
 *
 * The zero value of Cap is an invalid cap. Use emptyCap to get a valid empty cap.
